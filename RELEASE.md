Dyna&omega;o [repositories](https://github.com/dynawo) releases are available approximatevely every three months, based on best effort.
For each main projects ([dynawo](https://github.com/dynawo/dynawo), [dynawo-algorithms](https://github.com/dynawo/dynawo-algorithms), [dynaflow-launcher](https://github.com/dynawo/dynaflow-launcher)), Dyna&omega;o  is validated on a nightly basis with unit tests and non regressions tests. The compilation on different platforms is also validated on a nightly or weekly basis (Fedora, Ubuntu, Windows). 

A Dyna&omega;o distribution is always released for all main projects ([dynawo](https://github.com/dynawo/dynawo), [dynawo-algorithms](https://github.com/dynawo/dynawo-algorithms), [dynaflow-launcher](https://github.com/dynawo/dynaflow-launcher))  with the same version and at the same time. 

When a release is about to comes out, a controled release-candidate branch (labeled v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>) is created in each target project projects and integration tests are then started and analysed by the team (France cases and some key testcases from previous years).

Several assets are provided in a release of Dyna&omega;o core : release note and documentation, Windows release, Full Dyna&omega;o distribution with headers and on-the-fly model compilation with OpenModelica, Light version of Dyna&omega;o (no headers, no on-the-fly compilation), Dyna&omega;o distribution with headers, Full Dyna&omega;o distribution compiled on centos 7 and the Dyna&omega;o Modelica library.
